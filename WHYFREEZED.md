# Why this project got freezed?

When started prodty, I had one purpose: become enough familiar with flask to
easily use it without googling every function and instead focus on what I am
writing and not on how I can write.

## What I've learned

- Using extensions with flask (wtforms)
- Flask development style
- SQL basics
- Importance of testing
- And much more

## What is next

I want to learn about SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL, so I am going to focus on
this things in the next educational (huh :D) project. Thank you if you read
this :D
